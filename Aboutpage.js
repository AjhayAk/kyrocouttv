<div className="kyro">Kyro Cout TV Kyro+ Cout TV is an Indian brand of subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Novi Digital Entertainment of Star India and operated by Star Network and Entertainment Distribution. The brand was first introduced
    as Star Media Pvt.ltd. for a streaming service carrying content from Star India's local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming, as well as featuring content licensed from third-parties such as HBO and Showtime
    among others. Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country. Following the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Star Media in 2019, Kyro Cout TV was
    integrated with the company's new global streaming brand Star Media in April 2020. The co-branded service added Star Media original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Star Media Pvt.Ltd, Pixar, Marvel Studios,
    Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.
